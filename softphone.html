        <h1>Softphones</h1>
        <p>A softphone is software that enables voice communication over the internet using a computer, tablet, or
            smartphone. Softphones replace traditional hardware phones by providing the same functionality in a more
            flexible and portable form. They are essential tools in VoIP systems, especially in call centers and remote
            working environments.</p>

        <h2>Why Use Softphones?</h2>
        <p>Softphones offer several advantages, making them popular for VoIP communications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> No need for dedicated hardware, as any device with the software can
                serve as a phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Usable on multiple devices, allowing for seamless communication from
                anywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Rich Features:</strong> Typically include advanced features like call forwarding, voicemail,
                contact management, and conferencing.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> Works seamlessly with SIP-based VoIP systems, such as Asterisk and
                FreePBX.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Softphones in the project</h2>
        <p>In this project, we use three popular softphone applications: PhonerLite, Yate, and MicroSIP, in order to
            have multiple different phones on the same computer</p>

        <h3>1. PhonerLite</h3>
        <p>PhonerLite is a lightweight, user-friendly SIP softphone designed for Windows systems. It's ideal for testing
            and basic communication in VoIP setups.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Supports multiple SIP accounts, secure voice encryption, and an intuitive
                interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Perfect for small-scale implementations or as a client in a testing environment.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Yate (Yet Another Telephony Engine)</h3>
        <p>Yate is more than a softphoneâ€”it's a robust telephony engine that includes a softphone as part of its
            features. Yate offers flexibility for developers and advanced users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Customizable call handling, scripting capabilities, and support for
                multiple VoIP protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Suitable for developers and power users who need customizable VoIP tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. MicroSIP</h3>
        <p>MicroSIP is a lightweight, open-source softphone for Windows. It emphasizes simplicity and low resource usage
            while delivering high-quality voice calls.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Supports SIP/RTP, HD audio, and minimal memory footprint.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for users needing a simple, efficient softphone with basic features.</li>
        </ul>
