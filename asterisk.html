        <h1>Asterisk</h1>
        <p>Asterisk is an open-source framework designed for building communications applications. It serves as the
            backbone of this project, enabling the VoIP functionalities required for a call center.</p>

        <h2>Role of Asterisk in the Project</h2>
        <p>In this VoIP-based call center project, Asterisk functions as the PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system. Its
            key roles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Call Routing:</strong> Directing incoming and outgoing calls to the appropriate destinations,
                such as extensions, or voicemail.</li>
            <li><strong>IVR (Interactive Voice Response):</strong> Automating interactions with callers by offering
                menus, options, and information without human intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Voicemail Management:</strong> Providing a system where users can leave and retrieve voice
                messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Connecting with SIP clients like PhonerLite and external interfaces like
                FreePBX for streamlined configuration and usage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features of Asterisk</h2>
        <p>Asterisk offers a range of features that make it ideal for building communication systems like call centers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protocol Support:</strong> Supports SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), IAX (Inter-Asterisk
                eXchange), and other protocols for seamless communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Offers unparalleled flexibility to customize call flows, routing
                logic, and IVR systems using its configuration files and scripting capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scales from small office systems to enterprise-grade communication setups
                with thousands of users.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> As an open-source platform, Asterisk reduces costs compared to
                proprietary PBX solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uses of Asterisk</h2>
        <p>Beyond call centers, Asterisk can be used in a variety of other communication applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Telephony:</strong> Creating office phone systems with features like call transfers,
                conference calls, and automated attendants.</li>
            <li><strong>Call Recording:</strong> Recording calls for training, quality assurance, or legal purposes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unified Communications:</strong> Integrating voice, video, and text-based communication into a
                single platform.</li>
            <li><strong>VoIP Gateways:</strong> Bridging traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) lines and
                modern IP-based systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Voice Systems:</strong> Developing IVR systems for self-service applications such as
                banking or customer support.</li>
        </ul>
