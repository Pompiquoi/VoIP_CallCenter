        <h1>FreePBX</h1>
        <p>FreePBX is an open-source, web-based GUI (Graphical User Interface) that simplifies the management of
            Asterisk systems. It plays a crucial role in this project by providing an intuitive way to configure and
            control the call center's operations without requiring in-depth knowledge of Asterisk's underlying
            command-line configuration.</p>

        <h2>Role of FreePBX in the Project</h2>
